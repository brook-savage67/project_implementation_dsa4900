Gaming has evolved into a global activity, attracting billions with its immersive experiences and competitive challenges, but its engaging nature can lead to compulsive behaviors, especially among adolescents and young adults. Existing research on gaming addiction largely relies on biased self-reports or resource-intensive longitudinal studies and often overlooks demographic differences, limiting timely and personalized interventions. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a machine learning-based system that predicts at-risk gamers with over 85% accuracy and delivers dynamic, personalized alerts when playtime thresholds are exceeded. Unlike current models, this approach adapts to diverse demographics and gaming behaviors, combining predictive analytics with actionable, tailored interventions.
